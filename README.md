This project focuses on monitoring the performance of a Machine Learning (ML) model using MLflow, an open-source platform for managing the complete ML lifecycle. 
It provides tools to track experiments, log metrics, store model artifacts, and visualize model performance over time. 
By integrating MLflow, the project ensures transparency, reproducibility, and streamlined model management in both development and production environments.
